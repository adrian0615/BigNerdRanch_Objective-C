/*Notice that the asterick is used two different ways in this example:

When you declared addressOfI to be an int *.  That is, you told the compiler "It will hold an address where an int can be stored."

When you read the int value that is stored at the address stored in addressOfI. (Pointers are also called references.  Thus, using the pointer to read data at the address is sometimes called deferencing the pointer.)
